Fast installation guide (for the MySQL database)

(These paragraphs are taken from the Widi documentation point 3.1)

You need to have a webserver (we have tested the system with Apache),
PHP3, PHPLib and MySQL installed in your system.


* user$ mysql -h host -u database_superuser -p
  (insert superuser_password)
* mysql> USE mysql;
* mysql> INSERT INTO user VALUES ( 'host', 'operator', PASSWORD('operator_password'), 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N');
* mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
* mysql> CREATE DATABASE widi;
* mysql> exit;
* user$ tar -zxvf widi-0.8.tar.gz
* user$ mysql -h host -u operator -p < widi/sql/mysql.sql
  (insert the operator_password)
* user$ vi widi/include/local.inc
  (insert the correct database parameters; please, keep widi as the database name)

   var $Host     = "host";
   var $Database = "widi";
   var $User     = "operator";
   var $Password = "password";

Ok, that's it. You've finished installing and configuring
Widi. Start your browser and visit
http://yourserver/widi/index.php3.

If you get an error message or you have the impression that the system does not work correctly, have a look at this page http://yourserver/widi/test.php3. It will give you some hints on where Widi is failing.

If things do not work, maybe you'll have to read the whole
installation chapter from the Widi documentation.

Note: Translation support needs a lot of memory. We're looking for a better memory management for the translation function. If this is an important feature for you, think changing the php3.ini allowed memory input. You should change the default line:
memory_limit = 8388608; Maximum amount of memory a script may consume (8MB)  

with this one:
memory_limit = 33554432; Maximum amount of memory a script may consume (32MB)
