CODD is a tool for creating and analyzing statistical measures of "developer
involvement" in free software projects. By assimilating authorship
attribution information included in source files of the package, CODD
approximates the the amount of individual contributions from developers who
constructed the codebase. <p>

CODD is designed to do quantitative analysis of emergent, <a
href=>cooking-pot</a> interactions, specifically the free software
phenomena, which is difficult to "measure" without a statistical yardstick.
CODD acquires and prepares data for modeling trans-monetary value flow in
Free Software community and building analytical and predictive models of its
economic activity. <p>

<a name=description>
<font face=lucida,helvetica,arial size=+1><b>Description</b></font><p>
</a>
<font face=arial,helvetica>

Development methodologies built around the principles of Free Software
encourage distribution, reuse, mutation and forking of code. They also
encourage collaboration among developers working towards similar ends. As a
result many codebases tend to be a work of a lot of people in derived or
original form. Authorship information included in packages or repositories
that distribute the software rarely indicate the level of participation of
all developers. When present it is not in a form that can be used for
building comprehensive models of contribution.<p>

CODD greps through all source and documentation files in a package, line by
line, looking for developer attribution patterns. Using an approximate, but
deterministic, attribution scheme CODD generates an association relating
authors to the lines of code they have written. Though not strictly correct,
this is pretty high-resolution data, suitable for statistical analysis.<p>

</a>
<font face=arial,helvetica>

CODD is written as a set of Perl class libraries and programs. The two main
classes are the Parser and the Analyser. The Parser works on source code
packages; the Analyser on codd associations, the end-products of the Parser.
The Parser encapsulates the CODD algorithm which describes the process of
extracting contributor signatures and attributing bytes of code to
individual contributers. The Analyser provides methods for rendering,
merging, and manipulating codd associations (hereafter referred to as
codds).

<a name=algo>
<font face=lucida,helvetica,arial size=+1><b>The CODD Algorithm</b></font><p>
</a>
<font face=arial,helvetica>

The basic unit of input to the CODD Algorithm is a complete source package
of a software. The Parser interface accepts the path of the directory that
contains sources. <p>

<b> 0  - Initialization </b>
    <ul>

        Create an instance of the "codd" object. Among other data members, the codd
        object contains name of the project, package path, codebase size, and the
        name of the authors along with the size of their contribution in bytes.
        These fields are populated at different stages of the CODD algorithm.

     </ul>
<b> 1  - Recurse </b>
<ul>

    Walk down the subtree under the package path and identify all source and
    documentation files. The regular expressions that select
    source/documentation files can be found in the <a href=#filetypes><i>Filetypes</i></a> section.<p>

</ul>

<b> 2 - Scan Documentation Files</b>
<ul>

Pipe all the documentation files through copyrights, emails and RCS-IDs
greps as described in steps A, B & C. Store results for each file
in the codd object.

</ul>

<b>3 - Scan Source Files</b>
<ul>

    Pipe the first source file through copyrights, emails, and RCS-IDs grep
    as  described in steps A, B and C.  If no attributions are found in the
    source file, use the author ids from the closest parent documentation.
    Divide the size of the source file by number of associated authors and add
    the quotient to each author's contribution field. Repeat this process for
    all source files. <p>

</ul>

<b>4 - Commit to Disk</b>
<ul>

    Write the codd to a disk file (in the output directory). 

</ul>

<b>A - Email Grep</b><p>
<ul>    

    Match email address.  The basic code for email grep is: <p>

    <font size=-1><pre>
        LINE: for ( @$code ) { 
            next LINE unless /\@/; 
            my @m = $_ =~ /([\d\w_\=\.\%]+?\@[\d\w\._\-]+?\.\w+?)(?=[\s:>\n\r\)]|$)/gi;
            for ( @m ) { s:^.*<::; push @emails, $_ }; 
        }
    </font></pre>

        Look at the <i>emails()</i> method in Distribution.pm for more details.

</ul>

<b>B - Copyright Grep</b><p>
<ul>    


    Match copyright notices.  The basic code for copyright grep is: <p>
    
    <font size=-1><pre>
            for ( @$code ) {
                if (/copyright/i && $_ !~ /\@/) {
                    ( m%.*copyright (?:\(c\))?[\d\,\-\s\:]+(?:by\s+)?([^\d]*)%i )
                    && push @copy, $1;
                }
            }
    </font></pre>

    Gives higher precedence to email addresses; will skip lines that contain
    email address.  After matching contents of @copy are pruned with another 
    set of regexes.  Look at the <i>copyrights()</i> method in Distribution.pm for 
    more details.

</ul>

<b>C - RCS ID grep</b><p>
<ul>    

    Match RCS IDs.  The basic code for RCS Id grep is:

    <font size=-1><pre>
         LINE: for ( @$code ) {
            next LINE unless /Id|Header/i;
            my @m = $_ =~ /(?:Id|Header).*?\d\d\:\d\d\:\d\d (\S+?) \S+?/gi;
            push @ids, @m if @m;
        }
    </font></pre>

    Look at the <i>logins()</i> method in Distribution.pm for more details.
</ul>

</a>

User-level interfaces to the module code and tools for creating, merging,
rendering, and performing real-name substitutions on distributions, are
available as executable perl programs.  Most of the Analyser functions
are implemented here. <p>


<b>codd-create</b><p>
<ul>

recursively parses source files from a specified directory and builds a codd
distribution from scratch. displays status information while parsing.<p>
<font size=-1>
 usage: codd-create -codd=dist_name [-dir=output_dir] directory_of_sources<br>
 exmpl: codd-create -codd=linux /usr/src/linux 
</font>

</ul>  

<b>codd-create-package</b>
<ul>

Builds a codd distribution for a tar, rpm, spm source archive. The archive
is installed and untared in a temporary working directory (/tmp/codd by
default) and removed after codd creation. When multiple spms are specified,
separate distributions are built for all packages and placed in the output
directory. Requires rpm2cpio, cpio, gunzip, zip, tar and compress utilities
for exploding archives and conversion between formats.<p>

<font size=-1><pre>
 usage: codd-create-package [-work_dir=temp_work_dir] [-dir=dist_output] 
        path_of_packages
        
 exmpl: to build codd distributions for all source packages included with S.u.S.E. 5.2
        codd-create-package -dir=/root/0/DATA/suse5.2 suse5.2/sources/*spm
</pre></font>

</ul>
                          
</ul><p>
<b>codd-render</b>
<ul>

Renders a codd distribution as a text table and prints  it  to  STDOUT.  All
records are displayed unless limited with -max option.  Returns output in 
HTML if run as a CGI script.  

<font size=-1><pre>
 usage: codd-render [-max=number_of_records] dist.codd
 exmpl: codd-render -max=100 SuSE5.2.codd
</pre></font>

</ul>

<b>codd-merge </b>
<ul>

Merges distributions and writes composite codds.  Composite codds contain 
projectwise breakup of credits for each author.

<font size=-1><pre>
 usage: codd-merge -codd=merged.codd coddfiles
 exmpl: codd-merge -codd=suse.codd packages.codd kernel.codd x11.codd
</pre></font>

</ul>

<b>codd-truenames</b>
<ul>

Performs true name substitutions on a distribution file. A codd can contain
email addresses, rcs ids, developers' initials and names and, therefore,
have two or more records for the same developer. Several IDs for the same
person can skew the distribution and affect analysis results. codd-truenames
maintains a database mapping developer signatures/initials/ids/nicks to
their real names. A codd-truenames substitution collates all entries for a
developer into a single "true name" record. Users are encouraged to extend
this database.

<font size=-1><pre>
  usage: codd-truenames coddfile
  exmpl: codd-truenames linux.codd
</pre></font>
</ul>

<b>codd-benford</b>
<ul>

Surprisingly, the distribution of developer contribution in bytes as
generated by codd follows (or seems to follow) the <a
href=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BenfordsLaw.html>Benford's Law.</a>
codd-benford displays leading digit distribution for a codd along with the
ideal Benford values. codd-benford can be used as an independent benchmark
for the CODD algorithm.

<font size=-1><pre>
  usage: codd-beford coddfile
  exmpl: codd-benford linux.codd
</pre></font>

</ul>
